## About
This project is intended to be an AI that popups balloon on tray to notify something or say hello to you.

Name originates from the AI program "Meido-chan" of Akasaka Ryunosuke in *The Pet Girl of Sakurasou*.

This program does the similar things as the plugin Yui in SAO Project but user cannot use custom phrases in Yui but pre-defined sentences. I intend to do more than that.

User is able to set their custom phrases in config file. Beta version would be Chinese but you can set yourself isn't it?

About her name (her?), which one is OK...
* Meido-chan (Sakurasou?)
* Yui (Is this SAO?)
* Fubuki (KanColle?)
* Iona (...)

(~~Iona is the best!~~)
